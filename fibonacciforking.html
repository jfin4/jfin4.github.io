                    Figure 1. Concentrically arranged Fibonacci forking
                    patterns. The Fibonacci series is represented by the
                    number of nodes in each level of the forking pattern.
                    Within each level, the number of forking nodes is
                    approximately <i>&phi;</i> (&asymp;1.618) times the number
                    of sterile nodes, and represent sequential terms of the
                    Fibonacci series. For example, five of the eight nodes at the
                    fifth level of the pattern are forking nodes and
                    three are sterile. Furthermore, the sequence of the
                    forking and sterile nodes, while never repeating, is
                    self-referential. If a forking node is represented
                    alphabetically as <i>n</i> and a sterile node as <i>i</i>
                    then the first five levels can be written as <i>i</i>,
                    <i>n</i>, <i>ni</i>, <i>nin</i>, and <i>ninni</i>. As such,
                    the representation of each level is an alphabetical
                    composite of the previous two terms, as each term of the
                    Fibonacci series is an arithmetical composite of the
                    previous two terms.
