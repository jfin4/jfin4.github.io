            <p class="caption"> Figure 1. Pseudoconcentrically arranged
            Fibonacci forking patterns. The Fibonacci series is represented by
            the number of nodes in each level of the forking pattern.  Within
            each level, the number of forking nodes is approximately
            <em>&phi;</em> (&asymp;1.618) times the number of sterile nodes, and
            represent sequential terms of the Fibonacci series. For example,
            five of the eight nodes at the fifth level of the pattern are
            forking nodes and three are sterile. Furthermore, the sequence of
            the forking and sterile nodes, while never repeating, is
            self-referential. If a forking node is represented alphabetically
            as <em>n</em> and a sterile node as <em>i</em> then the first five
            levels can be written as <em>i</em>, <em>n</em>, <em>ni</em>,
            <em>nin</em>, and <em>ninni</em>. As such, the representation of
            each level is an alphabetical composite of the previous two terms,
            as each term of the Fibonacci series is an arithmetical composite
            of the previous two terms. </p>
