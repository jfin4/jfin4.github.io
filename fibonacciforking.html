            <h1>Fibonacci Forking Pattern in R</h1>
            <img src="images/ninninin.png" alt="Fibonacci forking pattern."/>
            <p><strong> Figure 1. Pseudoconcentrically arranged Fibonacci forking
                patterns. The Fibonacci series is represented by the
                number of nodes in each level of the forking pattern.
                Within each level, the number of forking nodes is
                approximately <i>&phi;</i> (&asymp;1.618) times the number
                of sterile nodes, and represent sequential terms of the
                Fibonacci series. For example, five of the eight nodes at the
                fifth level of the pattern are forking nodes and
                three are sterile. Furthermore, the sequence of the
                forking and sterile nodes, while never repeating, is
                self-referential. If a forking node is represented
                alphabetically as <em>n</em> and a sterile node as <em>i</em>
                then the first five levels can be written as <em>i</em>,
                <em>n</em>, <em>ni</em>, <em>nin</em>, and <em>ninni</em>. As such,
                the representation of each level is an alphabetical
                composite of the previous two terms, as each term of the
                Fibonacci series is an arithmetical composite of the
                previous two terms. </strong></p>
