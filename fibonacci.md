# Fibonacci Branching Patterns

![Fibonacci branching pattern](ninninin.png)


An arrangement of Fibonacci branching patterns. The
basic motif is the circular branching pattern, which is repeatedly
inverteted and superimposed at various scales. The branching
pattern was inspired by the Fibonacci sequence---the pattern
branches at regular intervals and the number of nodes at each
interval follows the Fibonacci sequece. That is to say, the number
of nodes at each interval is the sum of the number of nodes at the
previous two intervals. This arrangement was
[created using R](r-code.md).
