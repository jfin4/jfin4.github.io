    <h2>Under the Weather, Part 1: Creating a High Resolution Fog Frequency Map Using MODIS Satellite Data</h2>
    <p>December 4, 2020<p>
  
  <p>Summary: In this series we are exploring the relationship between fogginess
and home prices in the city of Seaside, California, using remotely sensed data
and online home price estimates. Part 1 describes accessing and processing
MODIS satellite data to create a 250-meter resolution fog frequency map.</p>
<p>Had I been slightly more ambitious I would have doubled by sample size by
downloading MYD35 as well.</p>
