            Figure 1. An arrangement of Fibonacci branching patterns. The
            basic motif is the circular branching pattern, which is repeatedly
            inverteted and superimposed at various scales. The branching
            pattern was inspired by the Fibonacci sequence&mdash;the pattern
            branches at regular intervals and the number of nodes at each
            interval follows the Fibonacci sequece. That is to say, the number
            of nodes at each interval is the sum of the number of nodes at the
            previous two intervals.

            I am fascinated by branching structures, they seem to show up just
            about everywhere. Plants are obvious examples. Every plant, from
            redwood to cryptantha, has a signature branching structure that
            allows immediate identification by a trained eye. Watersheds and
            cardiovascular systems are other examples. Branching patterns
            extend through time as readily as through space. Family trees are
            so named for their resemblance to their wooden counterparts when
            sketched onto paper, but that sketch is a spatial representation
            of a temporal process. We come into being as microscopic nodes
            embedded in the uterine lining of our mothers. There we are
            nourished until we grow too large to remain attached. An alien eye
            would find our resulting form indistinguishable from that of our
            progenitors. This self&ndash;similarity is another fascinating
            aspect of branching structures.

            <!-- Thought is branching structure. Perhaps it is better to think of -->
            <!-- branching patterns that extend through time as branching -->
            <!-- processes. Writing is the excruciating practice of pruning the -->
            <!-- branches that sprout each moment into a structure that goes -->
            <!-- somewhere. Perhaps this should not come as a surprise. Our -->
            <!-- nervous systems are interconnected network of neurons -->
            <!-- characterized by branches.  Perhaps the experience thought is what -->
            <!-- it feels like to be a system of interconnected neurons. -->

<!-- Wreckage --> 
<!-- It boggles the mind to consider the number of -->
<!-- branching events -->
<!-- Within each level, the number of forking nodes is -->
<!-- approximately <em>&phi;</em> (&asymp;1.618) times the number of -->
<!-- sterile nodes, and represent sequential terms of the Fibonacci -->
<!-- series. For example, five of the eight nodes at the fifth level of -->
<!-- the pattern are forking nodes and three are sterile. Furthermore, -->
<!-- the sequence of the forking and sterile nodes, while never -->
<!-- repeating, is self-referential. If a forking node is represented -->
<!-- alphabetically as <em>n</em> and a sterile node as <em>i</em> then -->
<!-- the first five levels can be written as <em>i</em>, <em>n</em>, -->
<!-- <em>ni</em>, <em>nin</em>, and <em>ninni</em>. As such, the -->
<!-- representation of each level is an alphabetical composite of the -->
<!-- previous two terms, as each term of the Fibonacci series is an -->
<!-- arithmetical composite of the previous two terms. -->
