            Figure 1. An arrangement of Fibonacci branching patterns. The
            basic motif is the circular branching pattern, which is repeatedly
            inverteted and superimposed at various scales. The branching
            pattern was inspired by the Fibonacci sequence&mdash;the pattern
            branches at regular intervals and the number of nodes at each
            interval follows the Fibonacci sequece. That is to say, the number
            of nodes at each interval is the sum of the number of nodes at the
            previous two intervals. This arrangement was
            <a href="ninninin-current.R">created using R</a>.

            I am fascinated by branching structures, they seem to show up just
            about everywhere. Plants are obvious examples. Every plant, from
            redwood to cryptantha, has a signature branching structure that
            allows immediate identification by a trained eye. Watersheds and
            cardiovascular systems are other examples. Branching patterns
            extend through time as readily as through space. Family trees are
            so named for their resemblance to their wooden counterparts when
            sketched onto paper, but that sketch is a spatial representation
            of a temporal process. We come into being as microscopic nodes
            embedded in the uterine lining of our mothers. There we are
            nourished until we grow too large to remain attached. An alien eye
            would find our resulting form indistinguishable from that of our
            progenitors. This self&ndash;similarity is another fascinating
            aspect of branching structures.
